# Suggestions development guide

## Summary
CopilotKit comes with suggestions behavior that allows an LLM generate (or the developer to statically program) suggestions that appear in the UI. When clicked, these suggestions will add a message. The logic for suggestions is currently divided between Headless UI or our Prebuilt components.

### Prebuilt components
Whenever a message is complete, suggestions should be triggered once. This includes at the start of the 
chat, when the user opens it.

### Headless UI
Suggestions should have an "initial" option, otherwise the user can set them manually with setSuggestions or generate them using AI with generateSuggestions.
